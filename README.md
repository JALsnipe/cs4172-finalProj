cs4172-finalProj
================

Team Oprah of Unity final project for cs4172.

Workflow:

4/7

I just created an empty project, empty scene, and installed the Vuforia SDK.

After you pull:

In Unity, go to File -> Open Project -> [your forked cs4172-finalProj directory]

If necessary, open the scene in cs4172-finalProj/Assets/_Scenes/Scene001.unity

Should be all ok.  If something looks broken, just reinstall the Vuforia Unity extension here:
